# Sharp the Game

### Note 

For now you can test out the progress by executing the Sharp.exe file found in the debug/ directory. Note that this has to be ran from a console/terminal

### Concepts I learn and use

* Access types
  * Protected
  * Private
  * Public
  * Internal

* Random numbers
  * Reusing the same seed class to get more random-ish numbers
  * Use random numbers to shuffle lists
